# DataPrints

DataPrints is a tool designed to build statistics and visualize them using "blueprints." It employs a 2D node system through a React-based frontend, enabling users to structure and visualize data in the browser. Rust serves as the backend to handle computing.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **frontend:** React-based frontend code for creating and visualizing data blueprints.
- **backend:** Rust backend responsible for handling computing and serving API endpoints.

## Getting Started

To clone and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pivius/Dataprints.git
    ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies for the frontend by running the `install_deps.sh` script in the frontend folder

3. Build the project by running the `build.sh` script in the root folder

4. Start the project by running the `start.sh` script in the root folder

6. Test the frontend:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Required for frontend.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Needed for backend.

## Usage

The project is designed to help you structure and visualize data using blueprints. The frontend provides an interactive 2D node system, and the backend handles data processing.
